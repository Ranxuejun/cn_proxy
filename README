Content negotiation proxy for CrossRef OpenURL API

Server Preparation?
===============================================================

Installation for an Ubuntu machine:

1. Install capistrano on your local development machine

$ gem install capistrano

2. Bootstrap a deployment machine with packages and gems

$ cap bootstrap -S domain=some_domain distro=ubuntu user=ubuntu

some_domain must be accessible via SSH and a user with sudo 
permissions. I usually set up my ~/.ssh/config file with a Host 
section for some_domain:

Host some_domain
HostName a_very_long_and_ugly_ec2_external_dns_ip_thingy.com
User ubuntu
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/karls-amazon-id

Host some_domain_deploy
HostName a_very_long_and_ugly_ec2_external_dns_ip_thingy.com
User deploy
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/crossref-deploy-id

distro should be one of ubuntu or centos (currently), and it
defaults to ubuntu. user should be the name of a user on the
target machine that has sudo permissions. By default this is
'ubuntu' since EC2 Ubuntu instances set this user up as one
with sudo perms.

3. Set up the deployment directory structure

$ cap deploy:setup -S domain=some_domain_deploy

Notice that we're running this command with some_domain_deploy,
so it runs via the 'deploy' user.

Redeployment?
================================================================

Now we're ready to deploy for the first time, or redeploy.
This requires three commands:

$ cap deploy -S domain=some_domain_deploy
$ cap configure -S domain=some_domain_deploy
$ cap install -S domain=some_domain
$ cap restart_apache -S domain=some_domain

The second will ask for some input - configuration details such
as service host name and CrossRef query key.

Is it working?
================================================================

All deployed? Check it's running with:

$ curl -i some_domain/heartbeat

Where is the deploy key?
================================================================

A public deploy key is installed on the target deployment machine
by the bootstrap script. Ask Karl or Geoff for a copy of its
private part, or change the public deploy key in the scripts/bootstrap 
file.

When making requests to the cn_proxy, I get "can't modify frozen
object" errors.
================================================================

cn_proxy uses an RDF library that, at time of writing, is incompatible
with addressable 2.2.5, one of its dependencies. Downgrade addressable 
on the deployment machine:

$ sudo gem install addressable -v 2.2.4
$ sudo gem uninstall addressable -v 2.2.5
